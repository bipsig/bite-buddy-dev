## Features

- **Pre-loader**: The website starts with a pre-loader that allows all the images to render before displaying the content. This ensures a smoother user experience.

- **Header**: The header section contains the BiteBuddy logo and links to the About and Contact pages. Additionally, there is a Login/Register button, although it does not have any functionality at the moment.

- **Featured Dishes Carousel**: The website includes a carousel section that showcases some featured dishes. However, please note that the carousel section may not be fully responsive and may break on certain devices.

- **Restaurant Cards**: A card section displays all the available restaurants, providing users with an overview of their options.

- **About Section**: The About page provides information about the website's features and functionality.

- **Contact Section**: The Contact page includes the address of BiteBuddy and a contact form for users to leave messages.

## Cons and Areas for Improvement

- **Image Optimization**: The project utilizes high-quality images, resulting in a bulky website that takes longer to load. Consider optimizing the images or using compressed versions to improve page loading times.

- **Responsive Design**: Some sections, such as the carousel, may not be fully responsive and could break on certain devices. Enhance the responsiveness of the website to ensure a consistent user experience across different screen sizes.
